This is a version of the FaceReplace program, a simple face-matching application, written in Java7 and Habanero
Java (HJ) 1.3.1 that utilizes basic async calls in HJ in order to achieve its concurrency.  In order to run the
code one must first have both Java7 and HJ installed.  HJ can be obtained at:

Once installed, running this application should only require running 'make' from the root directory.  This will
compile the source code and run the application.  Some things to note.  This version of FaceReplace is meant for
running timing tests, so there is no GUI component attached.  Instead, the user will see some output that displays
the results of running the application several times over on a given problem size.

The default problem size, determined by the 'run' command in the Makefile, is 64 x 64.  This means that the 
application will run using 64 subimages, each of size 64 x 64 pixels.  Other image sizes are provided in the

rawImgsForTimingTests

directory should one want to run the program with other image sizes.  Attempting to run with sizes set to 
512 x 512 will likely cause an error when Java runs out of heap space.  All other sizes should work.

See the HJ documentation, especially the paper at

www.cs.rice.edu/~vs3/PDF/hj-pppj11.pdfâ€Ž

for more details on specifics about the HJ runtime.
